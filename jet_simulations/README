This software collection is designed for simulating proton collisions, saving the
particle data and processing the particle data to suitable jet data. The simulations
can be done with pythia8, Herwig++ and pythia6 (TODO). Folder contents:

// pythia8: The files used for pythia8 simulations.

Usage:
 make main_pythia8
 ./pythia8.exe (number of events) (save file name) (setting file name)

// herwig: The files used for herwig simulations.

Usage:

// pythia6: The files used for pythia6 simulations.
TODO
Usage:

// jetsorting: The programs used for jet sorting and storaging.

Notes:
 rootjetsor and ptcut are in principle functional, but these are to be 
 combined and updated into a similar file as jetanalysis.

Usage:
 make main_jetanalysis
 ./jetanalysis (mode of operation) (read file name) (save file name)

// events: Event classes used for storaging data.

Notes:
 These are used automatically by the different programs.

 PrtclEvent should be edited only in extreme cases, since the particle data
 itself consumes massive amounts of space. Other events can be modified more
 lightly. If modifications are to be made, the appropriate branches and data
 variables should be created. Also care should be taken with the programs that
 use the results.

Usage:
 The events-folder is portable and can be easily shared. Thus, running
 '.L events/***Event.cpp+' allows to easily load the libraries needed for
 showing different functions present in the event.

// obj, lib: Objects, libraries etc. needed while building the programs.

// generic: Some generic files and programs that don't fit elsewhere.
