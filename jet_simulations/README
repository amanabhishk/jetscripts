This base directory holds the code for processing jets from Herwig, Pythia8
and Pythia6 particle data. The actual particle data is generated within
the subfolders. The scripts that are in general use are located in this folder.
If necessary, the Makefiles in the subfolders refer to the makefile located in
this folder.

SimEvent: (src/SimEvent.cpp, include/SimEvent.h)
A definition for the information that is storaged while making a simulation.
Built to a shared object, since this is frequently used.

SimLinkDef.h: (include/SimLinkDef.h)
Used to create a ROOT dictionary from the class MinimalEvent. Necessary, while
editing trees. Build creates PTDct.cc and PTDct.h in the obj directory.

libSimEvent.so: (obj/SimDct.o obj/SimEvent.o)
A shared object that corresponds to the created ROOT library. Necessary in
certain applications.

RootJetSort: (src/RootJetSort.cpp include/RootJetSort.h)
A script that is used within this folder. The purpose is to do jet sorting for
the simulated particle data for any simulation type.

Auxiliary scripts: (include/help_functions.h include/tdrstyle_mod1.C)
Some additional functionalities that are used in the programs.

Note:
A complete ROOTJetSort requires a more complex event class
