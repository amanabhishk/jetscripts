The folders 'analyzer' and 'histplot' contain the most important pieces of code. The 'analyzer' has some analysis code, which processes raw detector/simulation data to jet data. The jet data is stored as 'cakes' in the pt-eta -plane. The 'histplot' folder contains plotting functionalities for this 'cakes'. See README's in the folders for further info. Below is a deprecated version of this README, might contain something useful.

##############################################

This is a short recap that explains the functions of different files/scripts in this folder. The main purpose of most of the scripts is analysis of CMSSW or real jet data.

Files from other sources, used as templates for the scripts created here:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

fileopen.C, Dialogs.C, settings.h, mk_drawJetCorrectionUncertainty.C, JetDefs.hpp,
JECUncertainty.hpp, JECUncertainty.cpp, ErrorTypes.hpp, ErrorTypes.cpp,
drawJetCorrectionUncertainty.C, testSources.C, mk_testSources.C

Folders:
-------

KKousour, Hannouris, QCD:
An old and a new version for the handling of CMSSW style data sets

pdf:
Stored images

txt:
Jet energy corrections files

backupdir:
self-explanatory

luminosity:
luminosity info for an other way of prescaling

pileupcorr:
pileup corrections used for monte carlo data

CondFormats, DataFormats, FWCore:
directories taken from the CMSSW data package

.root files:
-----------

mc*.root: analyzed versions of the CMSSW data
Juska/old dataset, old/new PU correction

dt*.root: analyzed versions of the real data
Full: everything available; lumi/not: prescale method

fj*.root: analysis of pythia8 generated data

random:
------

setTDRStyle.C, tdrstyle_mod.C:
versions of a graphics style for root

TProfileHelper.C:
a class for .root profile editing, not created here

Actual Scripts:
--------------

AnalyzeData.h, AnalyzeData.C:
Basic analysis of MC/DT/Pythia8 data, makes pT-eta "cakes" that can be sliced according to the needs

AnalyzeHelper.h:
Small helper scripts related to the AnalyzeData class

ProfileBuilder.h:
A class for building the "cake-like" profile, including functions for using it

runAnalyzeData.C:
The actual root script that initiates the usage of AnalyzeData

HistScripts.h:
General small scripts to be used for modifying histograms

ProfileProjector.h:
A class to be used while reading the histogram data stored by AnalyzeData. Projects the desired part of the "cakes" to a 2D plot.

runDrawHistos.C:
The actual root script that runs ProfileProjector. Includes several pre-defined things that can be plotted, but also new things for plotting can be included. By default, this will compare histograms with each other, for instance MC vs. Data.

runSingleHistos.C:
Same as the previous, but here no comparison is done. Only plots of single results.
