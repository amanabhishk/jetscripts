Status Codes Conventions

These codes are used when the relevant particles are stored into the TTree in the first step.

1	final state particles, except the gamma from gamma+jet sample, and muons from Z+jet sample
2	final state particles that were excluded in the above case (the gamma and muons)
3	outgoing partons from the hardest subprocess
4	c hadron (ghost)
5	b hadron (ghost)
6	s hadron (ghost)
70	ghost partons
