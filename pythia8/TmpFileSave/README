Refined versions for Jet analysis scripts. Pythia8 particle data is saved to a
ROOT file. This can be quickly processed with fastjet.

## src/MinimalEvent.cpp include/MinimalEvent.h
A definition for data that is stored about an event.

## include/PTLinkDef.h
A definition for the linking of MinimalEvent to ROOT. Is used
to create obj/PTDct.cc/*.h

## include/help_functions.h
Functions for additional processing. At this time only contains the timer
for calculating processing ETAs.

## src/main_pythiatree.cpp:

Usage:
make pythiatree
./pythiatree.exe <Numbef of Events to create>

Purpose:
Creates a tree with pythia8 event data, using the event structure defined in
MinimalEvent.

Dependencies:
MinimalEvent.
PTLinkDef.
help_functions

## src/main_rootjetsort.cpp

Usage:
make rootjetsort
./rootjetsort.exe

Purpose:
Some basic jet sorting is done using the file created with pythiatree.

Status:
The current definition of MinimalEvent does not allow full gluon-quark
jetsorting.

Dependecies:
src/RootJetSort.cpp include/RootJetSort.h
MinimalEvent
PTLinkDef
help_functions
